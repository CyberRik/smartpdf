 INTRODUCTION
The boundary layer of a flowing fluid is the thin layer close to the wall. In a flow field,
viscous stresses are very prominent within this layer. Although the layer is thin, it is
very important to know the details of flow within it. The main-flow velocity within this
layer tends to zero while approaching the wall. Also the gradient of this velocity
component in a direction normal to the surface is large as  compared to the gradient of
this component in the streamwise direction.

 BOUNDARY LAYER EQUATIONS
In 1904, Ludwig Prandtl, the well-known German scientist, introduced the concept of
boundary layer [1] and derived the equations for boundary layer flow by correct
reduction of the Navier–Stokes equations. He hypothesised that for fluids having a
relatively small viscosity, the effect of internal fictitious in the fluid is significant only
in a narrow region surrounding the solid boundaries or bodies over which the fluid
flows. Thus, close to the body is the boundary layer where shear stresses exert an
increasingly larger effect on the fluid as one moves from free stream towards the solid
boundary. However, outside the boundary layer where the effect of the shear stresses
on the flow is small compared to values inside the boundary layer (since the velocity
gradient ∂u/∂y is negligible), the fluid particles experience no vorticity, and therefore,
the flow is similar to a potential flow. Hence, the surface at the boundary layer
interface is a rather fictitious one dividing rotational and irrotational flow. Prandtl’s
model regarding the boundary layer flow is shown in Fig. 9.1. Hence with the
exception of the immediate vicinity of the surface, the flow is frictionless (inviscid)
and the velocity is U. In the region very near to the surface (in the thin layer), there is
friction in the flow which signifies that the fluid is retarded until it adheres to the
surface. The transition of the mainstream velocity from zero at the surface to full
magnitude takes place across the boundary layer. Its thickness is d which is a function
of the coordinate direction x. The thickness is considered to be very small compared
to the characteristic length L of the domain. In the normal direction, within the thin
layer, the gradient ∂u/∂y is very large compared to the gradient in the flow direction
∂u/∂x. The next step is to simplify the Navier–Stokes equations for steady two-

Let us now examine what happens to the u velocity as we go across the boundary
layer. At the wall the u velocity is zero. The value of u on the inviscid side, i.e., on the
free stream side beyond the boundary layer. is U. For the case of external flow over a
flat plate, this U is equal to U•.
Based on the above, we can identify the following scales for the boundary layer
variables:

The symbol e describes a value much smaller than 1. Now let us look at the order
of magnitude of each individual terms involved in Eqs (9.4), (9.5) and (9.6). We start with
the continuity Eq. (9.6). One general rule of incompressible fluid mechanics is that we
are not allowed to drop any term from the continuity equation. From the scales of
boundary layer variables, the derivative ∂u*/∂x* is of the order 1. The second term in
the continuity equation ∂v*/∂y* should also be of the order 1. Now, what makes ∂v*/
∂y* to have the order 1? Admittedly v* has to be of the order e because y* becomes e
(= d/L) at its maximum. Next, consider Eq. (9.4). Inertia terms are of the order 1. Among
the second order derivatives, ∂2u*/∂x*2 is of the order 1 and ∂2 u*/∂y*2 contains a
large estimate of (1/e 2). However, after multiplication with 1/Re, the sum of these two
second order derivatives should produce at least one term which is of the same order
of magnitude as the inertia terms. This is possible only if the Reynolds number (Re) is
of the order of 1/e2.
The order of Reynolds number can be determined in the following manner. While
deriving the boundary layer equation, the basic assumption is that outside the
boundary layer, the inertia force is >> viscous force. However, within the boundary
layer, the inertia force and viscous forces are comparable. If inertia force and the
viscous force components can be represented by
